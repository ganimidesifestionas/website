    <span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">A Different Approach</span>
    <br />Our technical competence, and dedication to produce results are what you can expect in working with us. Our mantra of Independent Thinking, Honest Advice, is manifest in our everyday interactions with you and your staff. Here's what you can expect from us:
    <br />
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Forthright Communication:</span>
    <br />Candor means more than being truthful and direct, it means identifying, analyzing, and communicating the information in the most useful manner and early enough to be able to act upon it. We pride ourselves in communicating clearly with our clients, ensuring there are no surprises. Our independence enables us to hold our clients' best interest above all else.
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Technical Proficiency:</span>
    <br />You can always trust our actions and advice to be clear, well substantiated, and technically sound. Our consultants maintain up-to-date technical certifications and training, with over 90% holding the Project Management Institute's Project Management Professional (PMP) designation. The Sabot team also holds certifications in IT service management (ITIL ITSM), six sigma, security (CISSP), and compliance (CHP, CSCS, CHSS.)
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Actionable Deliverables:</span>
    <br />We never confuse activity with results and "Shelfware" is not in our vocabulary. Our deliverables are used to enable you to meet your objectives; it's the focus of everything we do.
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Professional Polish:</span>
    <br />our consultants are distinguished by our depth of experience - we have no rookies. With an experience level of more than 30 years, our consultants have exposure to all manner of technology and business environments.
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Deep Experience:</span>
    <br />When you employ even a single Sabot consultant, you have access to our entire company. We are not a "pass-through" staffing firm, but rather we are a team of professionals focused on providing a cohesive set of high-value services. Each engagement and every client is serviced by the entire company.
    <br /><span class="text-emphasis-shadow-bold">Close Relationship:</span>
    <br />We develop a close working relationship with our clients. We do everything we can to gain your trust. Sabot consultants are extremely dedicated professionals. We pride ourselves on being there for our clients when and where we are needed. We often spend out of the office time with our client counterparts to foster a more effective relationship in the office.
